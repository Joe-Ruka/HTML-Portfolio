<h1>The Best Movies According to Joe Ruka</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies of All Time!!!</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Star Wars Trilogies</h3>
<p>These movies have all you want from a movie: suspense, drama, action, romance, tragedy, etc. An absolute complete experience!</p>
<h3>Marvel's Avengers Series</h3>
<p>Some of the best action super hero movies ever! Especially Infinity War and Endgame. They both grip you from start to finish with huge climaxes and falls.</p>
<h3>Top Gun: Maverick</h3>
<p>The best sequel of any movie ever made! Though it was made almost thirty years after the original, it captured the same spirit and excitement of the first movie, and gave a fresh experience to a whole new generation. It captured the tragedy of the first movie. It also had the original charcter, played by the same actor. Absolutely Awesome!</p>
